          <h1>Variables</h1>
        </header>
        <p>
          In the world of programming, variables are like containers or placeholders that store data. They serve as a means to give a name or label to a specific piece
          of information, making it easy to reference and manipulate that data within your code. Think of variables as named boxes where
          you can store different types of information, such as numbers, text, or complex data structures.
        </p>
        <p>
          When working with variables in Python, you don't need to declare their data type explicitly, unlike some other programming languages.
          Python is dynamically typed, which means it determines the type of a variable based on the value assigned to it. This flexibility
          simplifies coding and allows you to change the contents of a variable easily. For example, a variable could hold an integer value at one point and then store a string of text later in the program.
        </p>
        <p>
          Choosing meaningful names for variables is a crucial aspect of writing clean and readable code. Descriptive variable names make it clear what kind of information is stored in them,
          which is especially helpful when working on larger projects or collaborating with others. Properly named variables can enhance the overall clarity and maintainability of your code.

          <h1>Declaring variables</h1>
        </header>
        <article>
          <p>
            In Python, declaring variables is a fundamental step in programming. It&apos;s the process of creating a variable and assigning a value to it. This is achieved using a straightforward syntax. Let's look at a few examples:
          </p>
          <span><pre><code>
  # Example 1: Declaring an integer variable
  age = 25

  # Example 2: Declaring a string variable
  name = &quot;John Doe&quot;

  # Example 3: Declaring a boolean variable
  is_student = True</code></pre></span>             
          <p>
            In these examples, we declare variables age, name, and is_student. The variable name comes on the left side of the equal sign (=), and the value we want to assign to it comes on the right side. Python will automatically determine the data type based on the assigned value, whether it's an integer, string, or boolean.
          </p>
          <p>
            One important thing to note is that variable names in Python should follow certain rules. They must start with a letter (a-z, A-Z) or an underscore (_) and can be followed by letters, numbers, or underscores. Additionally, Python is case-sensitive, so my_variable and My_Variable would be treated as distinct variables.
          </p>
          <p>
            Declaring variables is a foundational concept in Python and is essential for storing and manipulating data within your programs.

        </header>
        <article>
          <p>
            Local Scope: Variables declared within a function are local and can only be used within that function.
          </p>
 
          <p>
            Global Scope: Variables declared outside of functions or at the top level are global and accessible from anywhere in the script.           
          </p>
          <span><code><pre>
  # Global variable
  global_variable = 100

  def my_function():
      # Local variable
      local_variable = 42

  my_function()
  print(&quot;Global variable (outside function):",<br> global_variable)
</pre></code></span>
          <p>
            In this code, local_variable is accessible only within the my_function() function, while global_variable can be used both inside and outside the function, demonstrating the distinction between local and global scope.

        <article>
          <p>
            In Python, global variables are variables declared at the top level of a script
            or outside of any function. They are accessible from anywhere in the script, making them valuable for storing data that needs to be shared across multiple functions or parts of your code.
          </p>

          <p>
            Global variables simplify the sharing of information between different parts of your program, but it's essential 
            to use them judiciously to maintain code clarity and prevent unintended side effects. Overusing global variables can
            lead to code that is difficult to debug and maintain, as changes made to global variables can affect various parts of 
            your program. Therefore, it's generally recommended to limit the use of global variables to situations where they are genuinely needed for shared data.

        <header class="section-header">
          <h1>Constants</h1>
        </header>
        <article>
          <p>
            In Python, constants are variables whose values should not be changed once they are assigned. While Python
            doesn&apos;t have a built-in <code>&quot;constant&quot;</code> keyword like some other languages,
            it uses naming conventions to indicate that a variable is intended to be a constant. Typically, constant names are written in uppercase letters to distinguish them from regular variables.
          </p>

          <span><pre><code>
            # Example of a constant
            PI = 3.14159265359

          </code></pre></span>
          <p>
            In the example above, PI is treated as a constant because it's written in uppercase letters. It signifies that its value should remain constant throughout the program. 
          </p>

          <p>
            It&apos;s worth noting that Python does not enforce constant behavior; it's more 
            of a convention. If you modify a constant in Python, the interpreter won&apos;t prevent you from doing so. However, it&apos;s considered good practice to treat variables named in uppercase as constants and refrain from changing their values.

        </header>
        <article>
          <p>
            In Python, the if-else statement is a fundamental control structure that allows you to make decisions in your code
            based on conditions. It helps your program take different paths depending on whether a condition is true or false.          
          </p>
          <span><pre><code>
  # Example of an if-else statement
  age = 18

  if age >= 18:
      print(&quot;You are an adult.")
  else:
      print(&quot;You are not yet an adult.")
          </code></pre></span>
          <p>
            In this example, the if-else statement checks if the variable age is greater than or equal to 18. If the condition is true, it executes the code block under if, and if it's false, it executes the code block under else.
          </p>
          <p>
            The if-else statement is essential for creating decision-making logic in your programs, allowing your code to respond dynamically to different situations.

        </header>
        <article>
          <p>
            In Python, the while statement is a powerful control structure that allows you to create loops. Loops are used to repeatedly execute a block of code as long as a specified condition remains true.
          </p>

          <span><pre><code>
  # Example of a while loop
  count = 0

  while count < 5:
      print(&quot;Count:", count)
      count += 1

          </code></pre></span>        
          <p>
            In this example, the while loop runs as long as the condition count &lt; 5 is true. It increments the count variable with each iteration and prints the current value of count.
          </p>
          <p>
            While loops are handy when you want to execute a block of code repeatedly until a specific condition is no longer met. However, be cautious when using while loops to avoid infinite loops, where the condition never becomes false, as they can cause your program to run indefinitely.
          </p>
          <ul class="list">
            <li class="list__item">
              A common use of the while loop is for counting. You can set up a counter variable and increment it within the loop until a condition is met. For instance, you can count from 0 to 4 by starting with count at 0 and incrementing it until it reaches 5, producing the numbers 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4.
            </li>
            <li class="list__item">
              While loops are handy when interacting with users. You can use a while loop to continually prompt the user for input until they provide a specific response. In this case, the loop keeps asking the user for input until they type &apos;quit&apos; to exit.
            </li>
            <li class="list__item">
              While loops can also be used for numerical calculations. In this example, a while loop is used to add numbers from 1 to 10 and calculate their sum. The loop continues until num exceeds 10, accumulating the sum of these numbers.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            While loops are versatile and valuable for scenarios where you need to perform tasks repeatedly until a certain condition is met. However, it&apos;s essential to ensure that the loop's condition eventually becomes false to avoid infinite loops, which can lead to your program running indefinitely.
